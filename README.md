This repository contains the code developed to this
discipline. Some of the data generated was included
too. However, the data collected was huge, the size
is the order of Gigabytes, so it was not possible to 
include it here too. Nevertheless, the code included
allows to collect your own data using streaming API
from Twitter. Besides, it is also possible to classify 
and validate it.

Some dependencies needed:
- Python3
- Scikit-learn version is 0.18
- nltk version >= 3.2.1
- matplotlib
- geopy.geocoders
